Meanwhile the ship is in danger of falling apart and they have to figure out why.\nSEEKER says: Sounds melodramatic.\nRECOMMENDER says: It is. But it's still an okay movie....If that sounds too slow, try Life  (2017)  with Jake Gylenhal and Ryan Reynolds. It's a dark film about an alien life form from Mars.\nSEEKER says: Yeah, that's more my speed. :)\nRECOMMENDER says: In that case, also try The Thing  (2011)  . It's not a remake of the original, it's a prequel. It tells the story of what happened to the Norwegians before the dog shows up at the US camp\nSEEKER says: Oh okay. I never watched it because I thought it was a remake of the original.\nRECOMMENDER says: Nope. Entirelly different story....Also, check out Pandorum (2009)  with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster. Very similar to Passengers but much darker and no romance.\nSEEKER says: I'll check them out. And they're all on DVD?",

Did you like the new Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) \nSEEKER says: Can you recommend any movies that have a good story line and are post apocalyptic like The Postman  (1997)  and maybe The Girl with All the Gifts  (2016)  ?...I did not. I am not a star-wars fan unfortunately.\nRECOMMENDER says: Hmm.. I have never heard of the The Postman  (1997) . Thats okay. But Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)  was just a remake to make money. Have you seen The Hunger Games  (2012)  ?...What about The Book of Eli (2010)  ?\nSEEKER says: I agree. Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)  was nothing but a money gimmick.  I didn't care for The Hunger Games  (2012)   but I loved The Book of Eli (2010)  .  I should go back and watch it!\nRECOMMENDER says: I thought they were both okay. What about The Island  (2005)   with Ewan McGregor? That is sort of a  post apocalyptic movie.\nSEEKER says: I haven't seen that either!...I will have to check it out. :)",
