I'm not big into the comic book movies, but maybe I'll check it out....What's your favorite movie?\nRECOMMENDER says: My favorite of all time is The Notebook (2013) \nSEEKER says: That's a good one. I like it....I have a few favorites.  One of them is Forrest Gump (1994) \nRECOMMENDER says: Another great movie is Bedtime Stories  (2008) \nSEEKER says: That is a good one.\nRECOMMENDER says: Forrest Gump (1994)  is a fantastic movie. Did you see Patch Adams  (1998)  ?\nSEEKER says: I think I saw it.  It's been a while.\nRECOMMENDER says: It's not exactly a complete comedy, but I enjoyed it.\nSEEKER says: Still good....What kind of movies do you like?\nRECOMMENDER says: I enjoy romantic comedies or christian movies. Have you seen God's Not Dead  (2014)  ?\nSEEKER says: Oh yes....I thought it was good.  It wasn't great, but good enough.\nRECOMMENDER says: I'm really looking forward to seeing A Wrinkle in Time  \nSEEKER says: I don't know.  I liked the book and I'd like to see it adapted into a movie, but I'm not sure about this one.\nRECOMMENDER says: I hope it's good. Most of the time movies made from books aren't the greatest. Did you see Ender's Game  (2013)  ?\nSEEKER says: No, I haven't.  Have you?\nRECOMMENDER says: I did. It wasn't good, it was loosely based on the book at best.\nSEEKER says: Yeah, that happens a lot.\nRECOMMENDER says: It does. A movie I always watch when I can't find something else is Stardust  (2007)  it is a fantastic silly movie.\nSEEKER says: It's okay....The last movie I watched was National Velvet   on TV the other night.

I think one that is often overlooked is Phantasm  (1979)  .  Some of the dialogue is stiff, but it has a unique concept and great scares.\nSEEKER says: Oh that sounds really good! I like good scares! Anything else?\nRECOMMENDER says: If you like something that is creepy, there is The Omen (1976)  .  I think the original one is the best!\nSEEKER says: Oh I saw that! You have good taste!\nRECOMMENDER says: If you are in the mood for something that is more playful, there's always Creepshow (1982)  .  It's a collection of stories so I'm sure there would be something in there you would enjoy.\nSEEKER says: No I don't like playful. Looking for something intense!\nRECOMMENDER says: Thank you!  It sounds like you have good taste, too.  Finally, I would suggest The Exorcist  (1973)  .  Always my go-to when I want to be truly frightened.  I remember seeing the re-release several years back, being the only person in the movie theater because it was in the middle of the week when I was off, and jumping out of my skin several times because it was so freaky.\nSEEKER says: I really liked that movie though I watched it in the dark when I was young and made it through haha...Thanks a lot!!",
